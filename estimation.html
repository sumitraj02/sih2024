                    <h2>Carbon Neutrality Pathways</h2>
        <p>1.Energy Efficiency Improvements
            Upgrade Equipment: Invest in energy-efficient machinery and equipment to reduce overall energy consumption
            in manufacturing, transportation,
            and other operations.
            Building Efficiency: Improve insulation, lighting, and HVAC systems
            in buildings to minimize energy waste</p>
        <p>2.Transition to Renewable Energy
            Solar and Wind Power: Shift to solar panels, wind turbines, and other renewable energy sources to power
            operations, reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
            Geothermal and Hydropower: Explore geothermal and hydropower
            in regions where these options are available.</p>
        <p>3.Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)
            Capture Emissions: Install carbon capture technology in industrial facilities to capture CO2 emissions
            before they reach the atmosphere.
            Storage or Utilization: Store captured CO2 underground or repurpose it for industrial use,
            such as in construction materials or enhanced oil recovery.</p>
        <p>4.Electrification of Transportation
            Electric Vehicles (EVs): Transition company fleets and public transportation systems to electric vehicles.
            Charging Infrastructure: Invest in charging infrastructure to support
            the wider adoption of electric vehicles.</p>
     <p>5.Sustainable Supply Chains
            Green Logistics: Adopt more sustainable transportation options and optimize supply chains to minimize carbon
            emissions.
            Eco-Friendly Materials: Source materials from suppliers that
            adhere to sustainable and low-carbon practices.</p><br>
